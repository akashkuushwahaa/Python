# Python Programming Exercises

Welcome to my collection of Python programming exercises! This repository showcases my journey through various Python concepts and problem-solving techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each focusing on a specific Python concept:

- **Basics**: Fundamental Python syntax and operations.
- **Control_Flow**: Conditional statements and loops.
- **Dictionary**: Working with Python dictionaries.
- **Lists**: Operations and methods related to lists.
- **Mixed**: A mix of various Python exercises.
- **Sets**: Understanding and using sets in Python.
- **Strings**: String manipulation and methods.
- **Tuples**: Working with immutable sequences.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To begin exploring or running the exercises locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akashkuushwahaa/Python.git
   cd Python
   ```

2. **Ensure Python is installed**:

   Verify Python installation:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

   If Python isn't installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Run an exercise**:

   Navigate to any directory (e.g., `cd Basics`) and execute a Python script:

   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
   ```
